_Predicting bike-sharing patterns_

__Description__

In this project, I got to build a neural network from scratch to carry out a prediction problem on a real dataset! By building a neural network from the ground up, I had a much better understanding of gradient descent, backpropagation, and other concepts that are important to know.
